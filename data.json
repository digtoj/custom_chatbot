"ground_truth":"The purpose of the research paper 'Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention' is to propose a novel memory management technique that enables the efficient deployment and serving of large language models. The technique, named PagedAttention, aims to address the challenge of high memory consumption associated with large language models by introducing a paging mechanism that allows for the dynamic loading and unloading of model parameters. This approach seeks to optimize the trade-off between memory usage and computational performance, making it feasible to serve large language models on hardware with limited memory resources."
